abstract = {Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is an instructional strategy that is based on research and widely used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). This paper describes how POGIL can be a powerful approach to help students learn about patterns and how to use them effectively. We summarize a previously published experiment, which found that when design patterns were taught using POGIL practices, students' learning, skills, and engagement increased. We also describe activities to help students develop an understanding of why and how patterns are useful, how they are structured, and how to use them effectively. Future work should include evaluating these activities and their impact on student learning.},
