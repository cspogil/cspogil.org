  abstractNote={This methods paper describes the development, use, and initial findings for the Focus & Actions of Students & Teachers Observation Protocol (FASTOP). The ICAP model describes the benefits of interactive (I), constructive (C), and active (A) learning over passive (P) learning. However, instructors who seek to adopt more effective pedagogies often overestimate their use of such practices and/or omit key elements. Thus, our research seeks to enhance understanding of classroom practice by combining data from student surveys, instructor surveys, and classroom observations (both live and video recorded). This paper describes a new classroom observation protocol intended to monitor the focus (e.g., solo, pair, team, or whole class) and action (e.g., discuss, speak/present, watch/listen, or distracted) of both students and teachers (instructors). The paper summarizes relevant background on evidence-based learning, student engagement, and classroom observation protocols, describes the development and structure of FASTOP, presents results from different pedagogies (e.g., lecture, laboratory, POGIL), and describes lessons learned and future directions. Results show distinctive patterns of student and teacher behaviors for different pedagogies.},
