abstract = {This preliminary study investigates the impact of a collaborative guided inquiry learning (CGIL) approach on the retention and performance of underrepresented racial minority (URM) students in an Object-Oriented programming course at a Hispanic-serving institution. The study showed that this teaching method significantly improved academic performance for both URM and non-URM students, with no notable differences in retention rates. Student surveys highlight the method's effectiveness in promoting communication and collaboration skills, which are the foundations of inclusion and diversity in the workplace. The results also show that it was fairly easy to replicate the positive learning experiences across multiple sections of a course. This approach can potentially increase retention, improve performance, and promote diversity within the Computer Science discipline, contributing to a more inclusive and skilled workforce in the technology industry.},
