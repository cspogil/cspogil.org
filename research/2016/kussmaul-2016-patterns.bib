abstract = {There is a global need to improve the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of education. A variety of evidence-based instructional strategies have been developed, including Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). In POGIL, student teams work on classroom activities specifically designed to guide them to understand key concepts and develop key process skills, with active facilitation by a teacher. This paper describes POGIL and some advantages of using patterns with POGIL. This paper also presents patterns for the structure and elements of POGIL activities, including models for learning cycles (chart or graph; game or puzzle; terms and definitions), and ways to categorize questions (Bloom's Taxonomy; directed, convergent, and divergent; explore, invent, and apply). Pattern languages for POGIL should help us to better identify and understand elements and factors that make an activity effective (or not), and provide a vocabulary to promote higher-level discussions among POGIL practitioners, to help them develop, review, and facilitate classroom activities. Similarly, documenting POGIL patterns should help other educators to understand practices that are effective, wide-spread, and well understood in the POGIL community.},
