abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of CS faculty perceptions of the benefits of POGIL, the obstacles to POGIL adoption, and opportunities for professional development. Participants strongly agreed that with POGIL, students are more engaged and active, develop communication and teamwork skills, and have better learning outcomes. The largest perceived obstacle was lack of preparation time; other obstacles included availability of relevant POGIL activities and pressure to cover more content. Participants expressed a desire for further training and mentoring beyond workshops. Our data analysis also considers bivariate associations and interactions. The results should help to improve professional development for CS faculty adopting evidence-based strategies, and thereby help more CS students to be successful.},
