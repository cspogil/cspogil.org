abstract={Students learn by constructing their own knowledge -- and can learn very effectively from each other. We present four practices that leverage the power of socially constructed learning among students: Pair Programming, Peer Instruction, Studio-based learning, and Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Pair Programming is a process to guide students in learning more from the program writing process. Peer Instruction is a classroom practice to develop students’ analysis skills and a way of implementing a flipped classroom. Studio-based learning is a socially-oriented instructional model that is based on architecture and fine arts educational practices. POGIL focuses on the simultaneous development of both content knowledge and process skills.}
