abstract = {In spring 2015, Westminster College offered a learning community titled "Where Genetic Coding Meets Software Coding". All the students in the learning community were required to register for the same computer science and biology classes, which were each taught by the authors. Both classes had no pre-requisites and were targeted at introducing non-majors to the respective discipline. Students learned significant portions of the course content by working in groups on Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities, many of which were developed by the authors for the new learning community. Several assignments drew connections between the two disciplines. The activities were relatively effective in incorporating voice and higher order thinking to better teach for diversity, but the authors are still working to better incorporate differentiation, access, social justice, and equity into their activities. A comparison of survey answers from the start and end of the course show more negative attitudes toward computers, yet a promising and marked increase in interest to take additional CS courses.},
