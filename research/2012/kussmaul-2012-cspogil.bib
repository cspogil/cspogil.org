abstract = {This paper describes an ongoing project to develop activities for computer science (CS) using process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL). First, it reviews relevant background on effective learning and POGIL, compares POGIL to other forms of active learning, and describes the potential of POGIL for CS. Second, it describes a sample POGIL activity, including the structure and contents, student and facilitator actions during the activity, and how activities are designed. Third, it summarizes current progress and plans for a NSF TUES project to development POGIL materials for CS. Finally, it discusses student feedback and future directions.},
